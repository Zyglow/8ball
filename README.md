# 8ball
Screwing around with the Codecademy 8 Ball project

I was working through the Codecademy version of the magic 8 Ball, and after running into syntax errors I decided to make it better.

I've included the original version and any updates I've toyed with.  Feel free to do whatever you want with these, or perhaps try improving these yourself.
